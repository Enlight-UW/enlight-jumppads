enlight-jumppads
================

Jumppad code for the Beaglebone to be used during Engineering Expo at UW-Madison.

`jumppads.js` is the main JS file that should be included in your Beaglebone
project. The reason that this repository exists is to host test code to make
sure that the API access through this file works before deploying it to the
board (to narrow down the source of problems if things don't work smoothly).
